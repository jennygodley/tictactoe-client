## Planning

#### Wireframe

#### User stories
  - As a user, I want to be able to create an account, and log in when I return.
  - As a user, I want to be able to create a new game when I am logged in.
  - As a user, I want to be able to make my move in an empty space.
  - As a user, I want the game to end when it's not winnable, and not continue until all spaces are full.
  - As a user, I want to be able to reset the game whenever I'd like.
  - As a user, I want feedback about whether I won or lost.
  - As a user, I want to be able to log out when I'm done playing.

## Process

I started out making the board itself, using Bootstrap. I wanted to start with game logic next, but after some advice from the prior cohort, I made the curl scripts, just so I'd be familiar with what the API expected of me. This was a good move for me, as I might have written my game to send out values that wouldn't have been helpful for the API calls!

I finished my game logic relatively quickly, but tying the API and the game together was challenging for me.

Finally, I worked on styling the game——I really wanted it to match the wireframe I'd created!

## Future Iterations

I'd like to write functionality so that the user can play against the computer.
